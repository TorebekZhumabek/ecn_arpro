# ARPRO
Advanced Robot Programming Labs for EMARO/ARIA-ROBA and Robotics major at ECN.
Basic exercices to advanced algorithms that may be done in C++ and/or Python.

Lab1 is to get used to the syntax by doing small or less small exercises. The solutions are all given but of course it is useless if you have not tried yourself how to do it for some time.

Lab2 is used for the assessment (C++ only).
