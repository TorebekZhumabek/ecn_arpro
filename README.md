# ARPRO
Advanced Robot Programming Labs for EMARO/ARIA-ROBA
C++ from basic exercices to advanced algorithms.

Lab1 is to get used to the syntax by doing small or less small exercises. The solutions are all given for of course it is useless if you have not tried yourself how to do it for some time.

Lab2 is used for the assessment (C++ only).
